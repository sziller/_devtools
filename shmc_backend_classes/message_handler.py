"""=== Message handler =========================================================
General process to manage communication between Server API and Engine.

TLDR: Running parallel to Engine style daemons, MessageHandlerHub-s enable calling an Engine over an API.

User-> Frontend -> API -> socket -> MessageHandler -> Queue -> Engine

Depending on API's Endpoint setting, User requests are either synced of assync. The actual decision is made by the
architecture: usually time-consuming physical tasks are handled asynchronously.

Synchronized or Request-Response means:
User's request is interpretted by (thus: programmed on) the Endpoint to wait for a response from the Engine.
The Endpoint is not released until an Engine-processed response to the actual request can be returned. So the entire
range between User and Engine is walked through forth and back.

Assync or Fire and Forget means:
User's request is interpretted by (thus: programmed on) the Endpoint to be time-consuming. The Endpoint receives an
immediate answer from the Messanger, only confirming msg forwarding. Actual results will have to be requested either by
the User on demand, or by the Frontend automatically.

This module is designed to use in many of the Backend Engine setups.
The intended way to set up SHMC is to have physical systems interacted with dedicated RaspberryPi computers.
Each of these computers run as many Engines as necessary, and each of these Engines can be interacted with
over the SHMC central server.
Engines are quite independent, so they can run without network interaction on their own.
In fact most of the Engines are designed to handle physical induts and outputs as a background process.

Technology:
As Queue(s) between Engine and Handler must be set up in a common and higher scope, we run the MessageHandler as a
multiprocessing.Process, while - at the same time - we Instantiate the Engine.
This happens in the App_* framework.
This enables a remote server to connect to the socket if necessary. However, the Engine can run locally, even be
interacted with in daemon style.

Any remote Server can send its requests via the Socket.
Engines are turned on/off manually. (e.g. over direct ssh connection)
